in this file example of useContext hook in react.

useContext hook is a way to share data between components without having to pass the data manually through each level of components (known as prop drilling).

Avoid prop drilling :- hen you have deeply nested components passing props through each level can be hard to manage .context hook helps you avoid this.
centralized state :- you can manage and access global staate (like user setting or theme )accross your app easily.
